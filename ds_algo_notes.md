# Algorithms and data structures notes

### Graph Algorithms
- Bellman-Ford algorithm:
    - Finds shortest paths from start node to all other nodes.
- Dijkstra algorithm:
    - Finds shortest paths from start node to all other nodes. More efficient than Bellman-Ford. Edge weights must be nonnegative.
- Floyd-Warshall algorithm:
    - Finds shortest paths between all nodes in a graph.
